AL8G38390	AT5G61670	AT5G61670.1	Encodes a close homolog of the Cauliflower OR (Orange) protein.  The function of OR is to induce the differentiation of proplastids or other noncolored plastids into chromoplasts for carotenoid accumulation.  Both proteins contain a Cysteine-rich zinc finger domain that is highly specific to DnaJ-like molecular chaperons.  The AtOR protein interacts directly with the PSY (phytoene synthase) protein and acts as a positive posttranscriptional regulator of its expression, thereby affecting carotenoid biosynthesis.	protein_coding	ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA ORANGE (ATOR)	ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA ORANGE (ATOR)
