AL1G10810	AT1G01580	AT1G01580.1	Encodes the low-iron-inducible ferric chelate reductase responsible for reduction of iron at the root surface.  It is likely to be the major Fe(III) chelate reductase in Arabidopsis iron metabolism.  Coordinately regulated with IRT1, the major transporter responsible for high-affinity iron uptake from the soil, at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Steady state mRNA levels are regulated by several metals.  Its transcription is regulated by FIT1.	protein_coding	FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE 2 (FRO2)	FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE 2 (FRO2);FERRIC CHELATE REDUCTASE DEFECTIVE 1 (FRD1);FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE 2 (ATFRO2)

Embryo shape at seed maturity is globular-elongate. Other mutants convert the floral meristems to an indeterminate state, others yet show defects in ovule development. mRNA is expressed in all shoot tissues. DCL1 is able to produce miRNAs and siRNAs.	protein_coding	DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1)	SHORT INTEGUMENTS 1 (SIN1);ABNORMAL SUSPENSOR 1 (ASU1);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 76 (EMB76);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 60 (EMB60);DICER-LIKE 1 (ATDCL1);SUSPENSOR 1 (SUS1);CARPEL FACTORY (CAF);DICER-LIKE 1 (DCL1)

AL1G35370	AT1G21970	AT1G21970.1	Transcriptional activator of genes required for both embryo maturation and cellular differentiation. Sequence is similar to HAP3 subunit of the CCAAT-box binding factor. HAP3 subunit is divided into three domains: an amino-terminal A domain, a central B domain, and a carboxyl-terminal C domain. LEC1 shared high similarity with other HAP3 homologs only in central, B domain. LEC1 is required for the specification of cotyledon identity and the completion of embryo maturation. It was sufficient to induce embryogenic programs in vegetative cells, suggesting that LEC1 is a major embryonic regulator that mediates the switch between embryo and vegetative development. Mutants are desiccation intolerant, have trichomes on cotyledons and exhibit precocious meristem activation. Levels of the ABI3 and FUS3 transcripts were significantly reduced in developing siliques of the lec1-1 mutants, indicating that LEC1 down-regulates FUS3 and ABI3.When LEC1 is overexpressed from an inducible promoter, the expression of numerous genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is increased suggesting a role in positive regulation of FA biosynthesis.	protein_coding	LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1)	LEAFY COTYLEDON 1 (LEC1);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 212 (EMB 212); (AtLEC1);NUCLEAR FACTOR Y, SUBUNIT B9 (NF-YB9);EMBRYO DEFECTIVE 212 (EMB212)

Analysis of a T-DNA insertion line with a reduced level of Alb4 revealed chloroplasts with an altered ultrastructure.

Based on sequence homology in their motor domains, POK1 and POK2 belong to the kinesin-12 class which also includes the well-characterized group of phragmoplast-associated kinesins AtPAKRPs. Both kinesins are composed of an N-terminal motor domain throughout the entire C terminus and putative cargo binding tail domains. The expression domains for POK1 constructs were more limited than those for POK2; both are expressed in tissues enriched for dividing cells. The phenotype of pok1/pok2 double mutants strongly resembles that of maize tan1 mutants, characterized by misoriented mitotic cytoskeletal arrays and misplaced cell walls.	protein_coding	PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN 1 (POK1)	PHRAGMOPLAST ORIENTING KINESIN 1 (POK1)

Overexpression of AtERF53 driven by the CaMV35S promoter resulted in an unstable drought-tolerant phenotype in T2 transgenic plants.	protein_coding	ERF DOMAIN 53 (ERF53)	ERF DOMAIN 53 (ERF53); (ATERF53)

Thf1 antisense lines contain abnormal chloroplasts early in leaf development (chloroplasts have loosely stacked thylakoid membranes). Expression was induced in the light and decreased under dark conditions. G-alpha interaction partner that functions downstream of the plasma membrane?delimited heterotrimeric G-protein (GPA1) in a D-glucose signaling pathway. Localized to both the outer plastid membrane and the stroma. Probably involved in the metabolic pathway that controls the assembly of the PS II complex.	protein_coding	PHOTOSYSTEM II REACTION CENTER PSB29 PROTEIN (PSB29)	THYLAKOID FORMATION1 (THF1);PHOTOSYSTEM II REACTION CENTER PSB29 PROTEIN (PSB29)

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO5 belongs to the clade III, with AtMLO7, AtMLO8, AtMLO9, and AtMLO10. The gene is expressed during seedling growth, in cotyledon vascular system, and in stigma, anther and pollen grains; it was not expressed in rosette leaves, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s).	protein_coding	MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 5 (MLO5)	MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 5 (MLO5);MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 5 (ATMLO5)

UEV1C can form diubiquitin and triubiquitin chains in combination with UBC13A/UBC35 in vitro. It can also functionally complement an mms2 mutation in budding yeast, both by increasing mms2 mutant viability in the presence of the DNA damaging agent MMS, and by reducing the rate of spontaneous DNA mutation. It can also rescue an mms2 ubc13 double mutant in yeast in combination with UBC13A. MMZ3/UEV1C transcripts are found at moderate levels in most plant organs, but cannot be detected in the pollen or 2 days after germination. Transcript levels do not appear to be stress-inducible.	protein_coding	MMS ZWEI HOMOLOGUE 3 (MMZ3)	UBIQUITIN E2 VARIANT 1C (UEV1C);MMS ZWEI HOMOLOGUE 3 (MMZ3)

AL8G43410	AT5G65700	AT5G65700.1	Encodes a CLAVATA1-related receptor kinase-like protein required for both shoot and flower meristem function. Very similar to BAM2,with more than 85% a.a. identity. It has a broad expression pattern and is involved in vascular strand development in the leaf, control of leaf shape, size and symmetry, male gametophyte development and ovule specification and function. Anthers of double mutants (bam1bam2) appeared abnormal at a very early stage and lack the endothecium, middle, and tapetum layers. Further analyses revealed that cells interior to the epidermis (in anther tissue) acquire some characteristics of pollen mother cells (PMCs), suggesting defects in cell fate specification. The pollen mother-like cells degenerate before the completion of meiosis, suggesting that these cells are defective. In addition, the BAM1 expression pattern supports both an early role in promoting somatic cell fates and a subsequent function in the PMCs.	protein_coding	BARELY ANY MERISTEM 1 (BAM1)	BARELY ANY MERISTEM 1 (BAM1)
