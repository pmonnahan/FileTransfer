SSP4 and SSP4b were localized exclusively in the nuclei, whereas SSP5 accumulated in both nuclei and cytoplasm. All three SSPs encodes active CTD phosphatases like animal SCP1 family proteins, with distinct substrate specificities: SSP4 and SSP4b could dephosphorylate both Ser2-PO(4) and Ser5-PO(4) of CTD, whereas SSP5 dephosphorylated only Ser5-PO(4).	protein_coding	SCP1-LIKE SMALL PHOSPHATASE 4B (SSP4b)	SCP1-LIKE SMALL PHOSPHATASE 4B (SSP4b)

AL7G36320	AT4G18120	AT4G18120.1	A member of mei2-like gene family, predominantly plant-based family of genes encoding RNA binding proteins with characteristic presence of a highly conserved RNA binding motif first described in the mei2 gene of the fission yeast S. pombe. In silico analyses reveal nine mei2 -like genes in A. thaliana. They were grouped into four distinct clades, based on overall sequence similarity and subfamily-specific sequence elements. AML3 is a member of two sister clades of mei2-like gene family, AML1 through AML5, and belongs to the clade named ALM235. Among mei2-like genes, AML3 is the transcript with highest frequency of alternative splicing. Expression was detected during early embryo development (heart and torpedo stage); no accumulation was detected in vegetative and floral apices, as revealed by in situ hybridization.	protein_coding	MEI2-LIKE 3 (ML3)	MEI2-LIKE 3 (ML3);MEI2-LIKE 3 (AML3)
