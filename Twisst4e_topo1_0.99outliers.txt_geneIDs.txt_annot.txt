This modification alters the expression of the target genes (i.e. FLC, MAF4, MAF6).  Incorporation of this variant histone into chromatin mediates the ambient temperature response. Located at specific regions of the nuclear periphery. Expression throughout plants shown by in-situ and immunolocalization methods. Mutants show defects in fertility, leaf, flower and inflorescence development and shorter flowering times.  ARP6 also is involved in globally controlling developmental responses to ambient temperature through incorporation of variant histone H2A.Z into chromatin.	protein_coding	ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP6)	ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ATARP6);EARLY IN SHORT DAYS 1 (ESD1);SUPPRESSOR OF FRI 3 (SUF3);ACTIN-RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP6)

AML3 is a member of two sister clades of mei2-like gene family, AML1 through AML5, and belongs to the clade named ALM235. Among mei2-like genes, AML3 is the transcript with highest frequency of alternative splicing.
